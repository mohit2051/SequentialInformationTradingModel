# SequentialTradingInformationModel

This is an application of the Glosten Milgrom Model. Glosten Milgrom model performs the simulation of the process of the information impacting the formation of transaction price in a market maker model.
The goal of the model is for the market maker to learn the true fundamental value of the traded security from the information contained in the orders she received. In the original base model, we have three agents i.e., Informed traders(I), Uninformed traders(U), and the market maker(M); all the agents remain active in the original model. \n
I have also performed an analysis on the part where the uninformed trader can choose to remain inactive.

## Inactive Trader
Additional strategy to uninformed traders opportunity of remaining inactive.
